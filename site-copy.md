# I Am Not a Natural

I'm a revenue engineer. I build the data infrastructure and automation systems that turn GTM chaos into repeatable revenue. I've built it for myself and for others. And I am good at it.

But I am by no means a natural. I don't have some God-given gift for engineering. I haven't been coding since I was wearing braces, and I can't tell you what Big O notation my code runs at.

I'm a founder who taught himself to build data pipelines because the businesses I was building demanded it. The only natural thing I have going for me is the tenacity to keep wrangling data until it does what I need.

## What I Do

When companies are spending $20k a month on paid and their cost per meeting is through the roof — but half the leads are duplicates or garbage — I build the pipeline that cleans the data so they can run proper exclusions, tighten targeting, and stop paying to acquire the same person twice.

When someone from a target account hits the pricing page and no one knows about it, I build the system that catches it, enriches the contact, and pings the right rep in real time.

When companies want to reach their entire market but their emails are landing in spam, I build the outbound infrastructure — dedicated IPs, proper warmup, domain configuration — that actually gets delivered.

## How I Work

### Expert Calls
One-off calls for specific questions — Clay, tooling, architecture, whatever you're stuck on. You book time, we solve it.

### Scoped Builds
A defined deliverable with a fixed price. Data pipeline, automation system, outbound infrastructure. I build it, hand it off, you use it.

### Ongoing Advisory
A retained relationship for founders who want me in their corner. GTM strategy, systems architecture, what to build, what to skip, who to hire. I take on a small number of these.

## Who This Is For

Series A+ founders and GTM leaders. $3M+ in revenue. At least 3 salespeople. Already spending $15k–$20k/month on paid acquisition. Already paying for the tools — just not getting the results you expected from them.

ACV of $30k+ — so one new customer covers the engagement and then some.

## Who This Is Not For

Pre-product. Pre-revenue. Still figuring out product-market fit. If that's you, this isn't the time.

I also don't do fractional roles, retainers with vague scope, or "embedded" anything. I'm not your employee.
