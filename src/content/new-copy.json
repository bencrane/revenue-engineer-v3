I haven't been coding since I was wearing braces, and I can't tell you what Big O notation my code runs at.",

I set up your workspace with pre-built templates and automated enrichment workflows, and work with your team directly to get them building on their own. Templates, recordings, and tutorials — you keep everything. For a preview of how I leverage Clay, visit ClayExpert.com."

We get on the phone and sort it out. I've done both, and I'll know what's feasible, what's practical, and what's a pathway to idempotency hell."
